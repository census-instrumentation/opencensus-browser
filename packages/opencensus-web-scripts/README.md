# OpenCensus Web All (JS bundles)
[![Gitter chat][gitter-image]][gitter-url]

*For overview and usage info see the main [OpenCensus Web readme][oc-web-readme-url].*

This package brings all of the main functionality of the OpenCensus Web
packages into a variety of distributions for easy inclusion into web
applications via a `<script>` tag.

The library is in alpha stage and the API is subject to change.

## Build commands

To generate production minified JS bundles run `npm run build:prod`. For
non-minified bundles use `npm run build:dev`.

To serve the bundles from a local webpack server run `npm run
start:webpack-server`.

## Generated scripts

These are the generated bundles. Where we give the possibility to import either
only the initial load page code or the whole tracing code.

If you don't mind loading a single larger bundle on the initial page load, use:

* **`./dist/initial-load-all.js`** - This script combines the functionality of
    the `instrument-initial-load.js` and `export-initial-load.js` below. That
    is, it records spans based on the [resource timing API][resource-timing-url]
    for the initial page load and exports it to the OpenCensus Agent based on
    configured global variables. See the main 
    [OpenCensus Web readme][oc-web-readme-url] for details.

If you would like to minimize the amount of JS loaded initially, you can use
these two bundles to do instrumentation first and then an export more lazily:

* **`./dist/instrument-initial-load.js`** - This is a small script that sets up the
    instrumentation configuration for getting resource timing span data for the
    initial page load. Specifically, it starts recording
    [Long Tasks][long-tasks-url] and increases the
    [resource timing buffer size][resource-timing-buffer-url]. This code should
    be loaded as part of the initial page load
* **`./dist/export-initial-load.js`** - This script exports the resouce timing
    and long task information for the initial load to the agent. It can be
    retrieved after the initial page load has fully completed so it being
    downloaded and parsed doesn't need to compete with resources for the main
    page load.

If your application already depends on `Zone.js`, the case for `Angular`, use:

* **`./dist/tracing-all-zone-peer-dep.js`** - This script combines all the functionality of
    OC Web, including the *initial page load* and *user interaction tracker*. That
    is, it records spans based on the [resource timing API][resource-timing-url]
    for the initial page load and exports it to the OpenCensus Agent based on
    configured global variables and starts the interaction tracker for user interaction 
    traces exported to the OC Anget as well . See the main [OpenCensus Web readme][oc-web-readme-url] 
    for details.

If your application does not depend on `Zone.js`, that is the case for framworks like 
`React` or `VueJs`, use:

* **`./dist/tracing-all-with-zone.js`** - This script combines all the functionality of
    OC Web, including the *initial page load* and *user interaction tracker* to start the 
    tracing, plus the code of `Zone.js`. That is, it records spans based on the 
    [resource timing API][resource-timing-url] for the initial page load and exports it 
    to the OpenCensus Agent based on configured global variables and starts the interaction 
    tracker for user interaction traces exported to the OC Anget as well. 
    Using this  script you do not have to add the hard dependency of `Zone.js`. 
    See the main [OpenCensus Web readme][oc-web-readme-url] for details.
