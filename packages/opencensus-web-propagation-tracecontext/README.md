# OpenCensus Trace Context Format Propagation for Web Browsers

OpenCensus Trace Context Format Propagation sends a span context on the wire in an HTTP request, allowing other services to create spans with the right context.

This project is still at an early stage of development. It's subject to change.

See https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/ for details about the Trace Context
header format.
