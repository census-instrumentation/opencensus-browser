# OpenCensus Trace Context format propagation for web browsers
[![Gitter chat][gitter-image]][gitter-url]

*For overview and usage info see the main [OpenCensus Web readme][oc-web-readme-url].*

OpenCensus Trace Context format propagation provides utilities to serialize and
deserialize a trace context header in the [W3C Trace Context][trace-context-url]
format.

The library is in alpha stage and the API is subject to change.

## Usage

Currently the primary intended usage of OpenCensus Web is to collect
spans from the resource timing waterfall of an initial page load
and trace on-page user interactions with a series of features like automatic tracing 
for *clicks* and *route transitions*, *custom spans*, and browser [Performance API][performance-api] data.
See the [OpenCensus Web readme][oc-web-readme-url] for details.

This package is currently used to deserialize the `window.traceparent` global
variable that the server can send back to the client to indicate the parent
trace context for the initial page load.

This is also used to propagate trace contextspans for XHRs in the user interactions, 
serializing a `traceparent` header to send along to XHR calls.
