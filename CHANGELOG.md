# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

- Rename `@opencensus/web-all` to `@opencensus/web-scripts` so now this package 
    is only in charge of bundling OC Web to allow importing it as <script> tag.

- To use OC Web as an npm dependency, there are several options: `@opencensus/web-initial-load`
    to instrument with only the initial page load module, `@opencensus/web-instrumentation-zone`
    to instrument it with all the OC Web functionality plus the `Zone.js` library and 
    `@opencensus/web-instrumentation-zone-peer-dep` also exports all the functionality but `Zone.js`
    is a peer dependency.

## 0.0.3 - 2019-06-08

- Support custom end time for span (#95), thanks @skjindal93
- Upgraded types to match `@opencensus/core` package version `0.0.13`.
- Package upgrades
- Add support for object(`SpanOptions`) as an argument for `startChildSpan` function, similar to `startRootSpan`.
- Please note that there is an API breaking change in methods `addMessageEvent()`. The field `id` is now number instead of string.

## 0.0.2 - 2019-04-29

Fix: add JS bundles and source maps to the NPM files for @opencensus/web-all 
(#66), which were incorrectly not included before. This enables linking the JS
bundles in `<script>` tags via the unpkg.com or jsdelivr.com CDNs for NPM files.

## 0.0.1 - 2019-04-26

- TypeScript interfaces and enums extracted from the `@opencensus/core`
    package of [opencensus-node][opencensus-node-url]
- Initial `Tracer` and `Span` implementations. The tracer only supports a single
    root span at a time within a browser tab.
- Exporter to write traces to the OpenCensus Agent via its [HTTP/JSON feature][oc-agent-http-url].
- Instrumentation to generate trace spans for the resource timing waterfall of
    an initial page load.
- Option to link the initial HTML load client span with its server-side span by
  having the client write a `traceparent` global variable in
  [trace context W3C draft format][trace-context-url].
- WebPack build scripts to generate JS bundles to enable adding instrumentation
  of the initial page load spans and exporting them to the OpenCensus agent.
