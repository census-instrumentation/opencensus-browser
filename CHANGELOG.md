# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

- TypeScript interfaces and enums extracted from the `@opencensus/core`
    package of [opencensus-node][opencensus-node-url]
- Initial `Tracer` and `Span` implementations. The tracer only supports a single
    root span at a time within a browser tab.
- Exporter to write traces to the OpenCensus Agent via its [HTTP/JSON feature][oc-agent-http-url].
- Instrumentation to generate trace spans for the resource timing waterfall of
    an initial page load.
- Option to link the initial HTML load client span with its server-side span by
  having the client write a `traceparent` global variable in
  [trace context W3C draft format][trace-context-url].
- WebPack build scripts to generate JS bundles to enable adding instrumentation
- of the initial page load spans and exporting them to the OpenCensus agent.
